All the necessary data sets are uploaded in the respository and the full version of the project can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E0oQzebI779U6FzzRxIF9FqfbuNKM96Q?usp=sharing

Again, this is a project already uploaded in the website of the actual researchers of the project that can be found at  https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/

All that is done here and uploaded is just a simple reproduction of the work they have done already.

All the credits of discovering and maintaining the R package is completely done the actual researchers.

Thank you for understanding.!
